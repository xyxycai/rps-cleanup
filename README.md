# rps-cleanup-2022

We created a game of rock-paper-scissors, but does it actually work as desired, and is our code as maintainable as it could be?

## Setup

Create a virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n rps-env python=3.8
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```sh
conda activate rps-env
```

Install package dependencies (mainly for testing):

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the rock paper scissors game:

```sh
python game.py
```
